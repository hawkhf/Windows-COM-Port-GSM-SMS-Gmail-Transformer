This Python program is designed to transform SMS messages into emails and emails into SMS messages. 
It relies heavily on multiple Python modules, most notably:
'smtplib', 'gsmmodem', 'email.mime.text', and 'html2text'

This is a thoroughly unprofessional pet project heavily afflicted with scope creep, instability, poor documentation, and amateur coding.
